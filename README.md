# 🌦️ Weather App (Axios)

This project is a responsive weather web application that allows users to search for real-time weather information by city name. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses Axios to fetch live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The app dynamically displays essential weather details such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed in a clean and user-friendly interface.
